smalltalk-apalabrados-REST
==========================

Prototipo del juego Apalbrados en Smalltalk

This prototype was developed during the academic year 12-13 in the course "Object-Oriented Programming".

There are two different projects:
- The model and the REST interface: you need a well configured Pharo image (mcz file is available)
- The client application (desktop application): you need Cincom Visual Works (Apalabrados-View.st available)

I have added two files with a list of valid words (Spanish and English)
